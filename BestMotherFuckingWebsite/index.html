                You probably build websites and think your shit is special.
                You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get
                some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner or your
                site. You think your 40-pound jQwery file and 83 polyfills give IE7
                a boner because it finally has box-shadow.

                        had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)

            <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
            <p>
                You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking
                website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass
                banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent
                hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to you fucking site, and some
                motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers
                will never that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see
                that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.
                <br>
                <br>
                You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.

            <div id="first_reason">
                <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>
                <p>
                    This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook
                    logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load
                    100kb of jQwery UI just so you could animate the fucking background
                    color of a div? You loaded all 7 font-faces of a shitty web-font
                    just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of
                    your site? You piece of shit.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="second_reason">
                <h2>It's responsive</h2>
                <p>
                    You dum-bass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive,
                    but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking
                    screen size it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on
                    an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="third_reason">
                <h2>It fucking works</h2>
                <p>
                    Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read,
                    motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's
                    using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the
                    fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines
                    and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full
                    screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool
                    the jQwery ScrollTo plugin is.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I
                    fucking dare you.

            <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
            <p>
                Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his
                true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is.
                All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of
                what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real,
                naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.
            </p>
            <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck!</h3>
            <p>
                I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What
                I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are
                <strong>ones we create ourselves.</strong> Websites aren't broken by
                default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You
                break them. You son-of-a-bitch.
